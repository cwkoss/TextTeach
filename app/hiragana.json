Though Japanese also uses Katakana, for writing foreign words, and Kanji, ideograms borrowed from the Chinese language, Hiragana can be used to write all native Japanese words so it is an essential foundation to learning Japanese vocabulary. \n\nBasic Vowels.  Japanese has 5 basic vowels:\nあ - a - pronounced \"ah\", like the vowel in \"car\"\nい - i - pronounced \"ee\", like \"bee\" or \"key\"\n う - u - pronounced \"u\", like in \"moo\" or \"tube\"\nえ - e - pronounced \"eh\", like in \"end\" or \"bet\"\nお - o - pronounced \"oh\", like in \"joe\" or \"go\"\n\n\nあい (ai) is the Japanese word for \"love\"."},
